# Pizza-Sales-SQL-Analysis-

The objective of this project is to analyse the pizza sales data to identify key trends, patterns, and customer preferences. The goal is to use these insights to make data-driven decisions that will help the pizza store optimize its operations, improve marketing strategies, and enhance overall sales for the upcoming years.

The dataset used is a public dataset available on the Maven Analytics website in the data playground platform, which is an online resource of sample datasets, hand-picked by Maven instructors.
